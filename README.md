# CECS427 - Dynamic Networks

#### About
<p>CECS 427 addresses concepts and methodologies of social sciences to analyze
the relationships between social entities and market networks using computer
science frameworks. In particular, the course uses methodologies of sociology
and economy along with computer science techniques to identify social prob-
lems found in modern societies and provides a framework to validate social
science hypotheses.</p>
